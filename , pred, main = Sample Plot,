_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Calculates the economic value of a forecast based on a cost/loss
     ratio.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     value(obs, pred= NULL, baseline = NULL, cl = seq(0.05, 0.95, 0.05), plot = TRUE,
             all = FALSE, thresholds = seq(0.05, 0.95, 0.05), ylim = c(-0.05, 1), xlim = c(0,1), ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     obs: A vector of binary observations or a contingency table
          summary of values in the form c(n11, n01, n10, n00) where in
          nab a = obs, b = forecast.

    pred: A vector of probabilistic predictions.

baseline: Baseline or naive forecast.  Typically climatology.

      cl: Cost loss ratio.  The relative value of being unprepared and
          taking a loss to that of un-necessarily preparing.  For
          example, cl = 0.1 indicates it would cost \$ 1 to prevent a
          \$10 loss.  This defaults to the sequence 0.05 to 0.95 by
          0.05.

    plot: Should a plot be created? Default is TRUE

     all: In the case of probabilistic forecasts, should value curves
          for each thresholds be displayed.

thresholds: Thresholds considered for a probabilistic forecast.

ylim, xlim: Plotting options.

     ...: Options to be passed into the plotting function.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     If assigned to an object, the following values are reported.

    vmax: Maximum value

       V: Vector of values for each cl value

       F: Conditional false alarm rate.

       H: Conditional hit rate

      cl: Vector of cost lost ratios.

       s: Base rate
